# Atlas
Is your loot assignment always taking too long?
Everytime an item drops someone asks "How much is this?"
Are your raid leaders debatting the prices in officer chat?

Then i have the perfect solution for you!

Atlas + AtlasLoot Enchanted + AtlasQuest with GP price and fixed price display:


#FAQ:
###1. How to import my own guild prices?
Edit the file: AtlasLoot\Addons\dkp.lua and AtlasLoot\Addons\lasspriority.lua

###2. I am using DKP and want to have the addon display DKP: instead of GP:
Use the DKP branch on github

###3. I want the tooltip in another color that fits my UI
Edit line 3 in the file AtlasLoot/Core/LootButtons.lua

local ABRAXA_COL = "|cffff0000";

Lime Green would be: local ABRAXA_COL = "|cff00ff00";
