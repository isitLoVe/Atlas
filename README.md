# Atlas
Varua Edition:
Using a version of Atlas compatible with this version of AtlasLoot the instances were now split into Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms and I generally was always fed up of scanning through the list of instances for only the Raids.

So I added another list with 20 and 40 man raids called "Raids" sorted by progression level.



Is your loot assignment always taking too long?
Everytime an item drops someone asks "How much is this?"
Are your raid leaders debatting the prices in officer chat?

Then i have the perfect solution for you!

#FAQ:
###1. How to import my own guild prices?
Edit the file: AtlasLoot\Addons\dkp.lua and AtlasLoot\Addons\classpriority.lua

###2. I am using DKP and want to have the addon display DKP: instead of GP:
Use the DKP branch on github

###3. I want the tooltip in another color that fits my UI
Edit line 3 in the file AtlasLoot/Core/LootButtons.lua

local ABRAXA_COL = "|cffff0000";

Lime Green would be: local ABRAXA_COL = "|cff00ff00";
